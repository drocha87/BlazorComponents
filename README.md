# Drocha Blazor Components

Drocha Blazor Components is a set of UI components and other useful extensions for [Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-6.0) applications. All components are free to use. **This project is experimental.**

## About the project

The main goal of this project is provide components to be used in my personal projects. You are free to fork it or to use it as it is. As I said this is a personal project, so don't expect me implementing features that you ask for or even fix issues that you may report.

## Components

These are some of the components I expect to implement in the next couple months

- [x] Popover (partial implemented)
- [x] Tooltip
- [x] Teleport (like the teleport in vuejs)
- [ ] Dialog
- [ ] Mention Textarea
